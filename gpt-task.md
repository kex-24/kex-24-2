# Personalized Programming Task: The Avian Adventure

## Objective

In this task, you will practice object-oriented programming concepts in Java by designing and implementing classes, methods, and objects. Your theme will take flight in the fascinating world of birds, where each bird has unique attributes and behaviors. This task will give you hands-on experience in designing classes, adding fields and methods, managing object creation, and encapsulation through getters and setters. 

## Deadline

Submit this assignment before the next Java programming session.

## Instructions

For details on how to complete and submit this assignment, refer to the assignments section of the course instructions available on your course portal.

## Preparation

- Ensure you've completed and understood all questions in Module 2: Looking Inside Classes.
- Review the provided reading materials on classes, objects, constructors, getters, setters, and encapsulation.

## Learning Goals

- Understanding of Java class design
- Implementation of fields and constructors
- Creation and use of getters and setters
- Manipulation with dot operator
- Practical use of the `main` method
- Grasping the concepts of scope and variable shadowing

## Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter any issues,
1. Check the posted issues on the course's Git repository. Other students might have encountered similar issues.
2. If your issue is unique, create a New Issue with a descriptive title.
3. Utilize the weekly lab sessions to ask TAs questions in person. 

Collaboration with peers is encouraged, but do not share direct answers.

## Assignment

**Background:**

In an unnamed forest on the outskirts of an uncharted city, there exists a realm inhabited by extraordinary birds. Each bird has distinctive characteristics and abilities. Your mission is to bring this avian world to life by modeling these birds in Java.

### Bird Class Design

Start by creating a new Java file named `Bird.java`. This file will encapsulate the `Bird` class. Once created, provide the bird with the following attributes (fields):

- String species
- int age
- float wingspan (in centimeters)
- boolean canFly
- String favoriteFood

### Implementing Birds (Object creation)

- Implement a constructor in the `Bird` class that allows setting all attributes during object initialization.
- Create three different bird objects in your main method showcasing varied species, age, wingspan, etc.
- Utilize getters and setters to manage access to the bird objects' fields.

### Bird Behaviors

- Implement a method `sing()` that prints a unique song to the console for each bird.
- Add an `eat(String food)` method that allows the bird to consume different foods. If the food matches the bird's favorite food, print a special message.
- Design an `attemptFlight()` method that determines whether a bird can fly. If the bird cannot fly, print an appropriate message.

### Display Information

- Create a method `displayInfo()` in your `Bird` class that prints all the information about the bird (species, age, etc.) to the console.

### Engaging Scenarios

- Concoct a scenario where two birds meet, try to eat the same piece of food, and then try to fly together. Utilize your methods to bring this scene to life in the main method.

## Conclusion

This programming task is designed to solidify your understanding of basic object-oriented programming concepts in Java. By creating and managing your bird objects, you will get a closer look at how classes and objects can be used to model real-world scenarios.

## Submission Checklist

- Bird class with fields, constructor, getters, and setters.
- Implementation of at least three distinct bird objects.
- Functionality for birds to sing, eat, and attempt to fly.
- A method to display bird information neatly.
- A creative scenario involving bird interactions.

If you identify any problems or inconsistencies within this exercise, please report them, so we can improve the task for future students.
